FP Milestone1

Lan Lou: Implemented game engine update function and player physics.

Bowen Yang: Implemented efficient terrain rendering and chunking.

Jie Meng: Implemented procedural terrain.

Key binding:
Press W, A, S, D to move in four traditional horizontal directions, in the meantime , you will be able to run by holding shift, press 1, 2 to change fov, and press spacebar to jump in normal mode, press F to toggle on/off flying mode, in this mode, you can move vertically by either pressing spacebar(up) and E(down) or pressing Q(up) and E(down).

Additional words from each programmers:

Bowen Yang: Implementing chunks was a challenging task indeed. Given the fact that every one of the group would be using my code, it was quite tricky to design the public interface, so that my members could use my library in a graceful manner without tampering the internal states or abusing private utility functions. With a nicely designed enclosure, we could debug our code seperately.
